									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>I was first introduced to the world of programming in sixth form, where my friend would host a weekly coding club which I would attend after school. 
										I was taught Python as my very first language and was immediately hooked in after my first “Print(“Hello, World”) statement.<br><br>
										I would attempt to develop small text-based adventure games during this time with the skills and knowledge I had learned but it wasn't until my 
										Mathematics degree at University where I would truly find my passion for software development.<br><br>
										Throughout my course there would be several modules which involved us learning a programming language so that we could utilise its capabilities for 
										solving mathematical and statistical problems. In this time I was taught MatLab, R, Maple, Bash and even Python again - as well as other important skills 
										such as parallelising my code and externally running my program through the University's supercomputer.<br><br>
										After my degree I would use Codecademy to further develop my skills in my own time, first learning Java and its object-based principles and then 
										transferring that knowledge to C# which is the language I'm now most familiar with.</p>

										<h2>Turn-Based RPG</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A turn based RPG I'm developing within React.JS to gain a better understanding of the library and for the fun of it.
										I have plans to develop this project into a larger "rogue-like" game.

										<h2>REST-API</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A REST-API I am currently working on, using a video game's shop inventory as its template. This client has docker capabilities, 
										uses MongoDB for its database and can be accessed either through Swagger UI or Postman.

										<h2>Football Predictor</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A project I was working on which used statistical models paired with a file containing all of the previous 3 season's head-to-head 
										results to try and predict the probability of a win, draw or a loss of an upcoming Premier League fixture. This code is limited to 
										Arsenal as the only team you can choose. Currently learning React through Codecademy so that I can implement a user interface for this program.
